# Employment

## Geospatial Experience

\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{\extracolsep{\fill}} l c r}
\large\textbf{Senior Data Scientist (Technical Lead)} & \large\textbf{vertify.earth / Vertical 52} & \large\textit{June 2024 – Present} \\
\textbf{Data Scientist} & & \textit{Oct 2023 – May 2024} \\
\end{tabular*}

Led the development of applied machine learning pipelines for environmental monitoring and satellite-based media intelligence. Served as the technical focal point across teams, guiding EO product design, mentoring analysts, and deploying reproducible workflows at scale.

**Leadership & Consulting**

- Acted as primary technical consultant across interdisciplinary teams, advising on geospatial ML, satellite data integration, and reproducibility
- Guided organizational shift from GUI-based workflows (**GEE**, **ArcGIS**) to scalable, automated pipelines in **Python**
- Designed cloud infrastructure for EO delivery on **AWS**, with prototyping on **Google Cloud**, and standardized **STAC/COG** adoption 
- Mentored junior analysts and non-technical users (e.g. exiled journalists) in reproducible pipelines and satellite-based conflict monitoring
- Represented the organization at high-level international events including **COP28 (Dubai)**, **SatSummit (Lisbon)**, **ESA EO Workshop (Rome)**, and **GeoMob (Berlin)**
  
**Flagship Projects**

- **Biomass Estimation via Deep Learning Ensemble:**  
  Developed a custom deep learning ensemble to estimate forest biomass and carbon sinks in India using multi-sensor EO data. Constructed training datasets from **airborne LiDAR** and **ISRO ground-truth**. Achieved **R² = 0.87** and **MAE = 18**, enabling early-stage public tool prototypes.

- **Impervious Surface Detection (Computer Vision):**  
  Designed and deployed ML pipelines to detect impervious surfaces across German cities using RGBI (50cm), PlanetScope, and Sentinel-2 imagery. Integrated preprocessing, classification, and validation stages for scalable, city-level mapping products.

- **Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) Prediction:**  
  Built machine learning models to estimate SOC for climate and restoration projects in India (GIZ India) and Germany (EU LUCAS dataset), using EO predictors (Sentinel-2, DEMs, climate layers) and partner-provided ground truth. Hosted reproducible outputs on **GitHub** and **Hugging Face**.

**Additional Contributions**

- Created operational **SAR-based damage proxy maps** for humanitarian response in Gaza, Ukraine, and Turkey (2023 earthquake), combining coherence change analysis, infrastructure overlays, and rapid event timelines 
- Produced **flood impact assessments** for the Rhine River overflow in Germany, using Sentinel-1 time-series analysis and terrain-aware flood delineation
- Developed workflows to estimate **affected infrastructure and critical assets** (buildings, hospitals, roads) by integrating **OpenStreetMap**, **Microsoft**, and **Google building footprints** with geospatial damage layers
- Delivered high-quality EO outputs and maps used by journalists, humanitarian analysts, and partner organizations — see highlights in [Media Contributions](https://abdulnajah.com/posts/media-contributions/)
- Validated results through multi-source overlays and remote verification techniques, ensuring defensibility for both public reporting and internal review

**Tools & Stack**  : Python, R, QGIS, Google Earth Engine, PyTorch, Hugging Face, Git, STAC, COG, AWS
